#### Dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP)
- It dynamically asign IP addresses to the host and notify them information about network configuration.
It is a client-serer type application-layer protocol that uses UDP
- Server: DHCP server (can be multiple, port number: 67)
- client: Host that is newly connected to the network (port number: 68)

The basic flow
1. DHCP server discovery: The client broadcasts *DHCP discovery message*
2. DHCP server offer: The DHCP server broadcasts to reply assigned IP address and expiring term
3. DHCP request: The client selects a server and echo back the IP address bout to be used
4. The server sends ACK with network configuration ingfrmation
 Hosts acquire the new IP address everytime change the network to connect

#### IPv6
It is installed as a countermasure against an address depletion of IPv4

**Added features from IPv4**
- Extended Address space
    - 32 bits to 128 bits
- Any cast address
    - Communicate with any one of host in a ost group
- 40 bytes fixed length header
     Fast packet processing
- Detailed classification of packets based on flow label and trafic class

**Deleted features (ALL RELATED TO FAST PACKET PROCESSING)**
- Fragmentation
    - It can be performed only at starging node (path MTU search)
    - If it cannot be transported, is discarded and notify that to the starting point server
- Header check sum
    - Trust upper and lower layers and is not performed in IPv6
    - Hop-wise recalculation because of change of TTL is omitted
- Option
    - Fixed length header
    - Prepare many options using *next header field*

### Principle of routing
Routing alogorithm: solution of *shortest path problem (SPB)*
given condition: 
- Network topology
- Each link's cost
Objective: Find a path that minimize the sum of link costs

**Formulation of SPB**
$\mathcal{V}$: set of nodes 
$\mathcal{E}$: set of edges
$c(i,j)$: cost of link $(i,j)$
$s \in \mathcal{V}$: start node
$d \in \mathcal{V}$: end node
$x(i,j)$ 1 if used, 0 otherwise

$$
\text{minimize}~\sum_{(i,j)\in\mathcal{E}} c(i,j)x(i,j) \\
\text{subject to}~x(i,j) \in \lbrace 0,1\rbrace,~\sum_{(s,j)\in\mathcal{E}}x(s,j)=1,~\sum_{(i,d)\in\mathcal{E}}x(i,d)=1,~\sum_{(i,j)\in\mathcal{E}}x(i,j)-\sum_{(j,k)\in\mathcal{E}}x(j,k)=0~\text{for}~i\in\mathcal{E}-\lbrace,d\rbrace
$$
where the last constraint mean if it includes a link that into node $j$, it also has to include the link from node $j$.

- Dijkstra algorithm
    - Concentration type, there is only one start node $s$ and others are end node
- Belleman-Ford algorithm
    - Distributed async (cooperative) type
    - Exchanging information with adjacent nodes to make the path
