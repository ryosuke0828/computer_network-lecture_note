## Application Layer Protocols

### 2.1 Fundamentals

#### 2.1.1 Application Layer Protocols

- Network application: Software that assumes the use of a network
    - e.g., Web applications consist of multiple software components such as browsers (Chrome, Safari, etc.) and web servers (Apache, etc.)

- Application layer protocol: A part of network applications
    - Defines how messages are exchanged and the types/formats of messages
- Network applications generally have both client and server aspects (e.g., the relationship between web browsers and web servers)
- Inter-process communication via networks
    - Communication between processes on two end systems via a network
    - Uses a virtual interface called a socket
    - A socket is also called an API (Application Programming Interface)
    - More specifically, it is the interface between the application layer and the transport layer
- Connection (flow) unit (information assigned by the application layer)
    - IP addresses of sending and receiving hosts
    - Port numbers of sending and receiving processes
        - Determines which process within a host to deliver to
        - The server-side port number must be known in advance by the client.
        - Server-side port numbers for representative application layer protocols are reserved (**Well-Known ports**)
        - e.g., HTTP: 80, SMTP: 25, DNS: 53, etc.

#### 2.1.2 Services Provided by the Transport Layer

- **TCP Service**
    - Connection-oriented: Full-duplex TCP connection, communication after handshaking
    - Reliable data transfer: Guarantees communication without transmission errors and maintains correct packet order
    - Congestion control, flow control: Transmission rate varies depending on the situation
- **UDP Service**
    - Minimal data transfer service: Does not guarantee packet order or accurate arrival
    - Connectionless: No handshaking
    - No congestion control or flow control: Transmission rate is determined by the sending process

Examples:

| Application | Application Layer Protocol | Transport Layer Protocol |
|-------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Email | SMTP | TCP |
| Remote access | Telnet, SSH | TCP |
| Web | HTTP | TCP |
| File transfer | FTP | TCP |
| Streaming audio/video | Individual protocols or HTTP (YouTube) | UDP/TCP |
| IP telephony | Individual protocols | Mostly UDP |


#### 2.1.3 Classification of Application Layer Protocols

- **Pull-type and Push-type**
    - Pull-type protocols
        - HTTP, FTP, etc.
        - Users pull information as needed
    - Push-type protocols
        - SMTP, etc.: The sender pushes information to the recipient
- **Out-of-band and In-band**
    - Out-of-band method
        - Uses separate connections for control and data
        - e.g., FTP
    - In-band method
        - Uses the same connection for control and data
        - e.g., HTTP

â€» The concept of out-of-band exists in various scenarios
- OpenFlow (Software for Software Defined Networking (SDN))
- C/U separation in 5G (Phantom cell)
    - Macro cell transmits control signals
    - Small cell performs high-speed data transfer

### 2.2 Web and HTTP

#### 2.2.1 Overview of HTTP

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Application layer protocol for the Web
- Web object: Content such as HTML files, various images, JavaScript, audio/video, etc.
- Web page: A collection of a base HTML file and several web objects (URL includes hostname, pathname, and filename)
- Web browser: HTTP client that displays web pages
    - e.g., Edge, Safari, Chrome, Firefox
- Web server: HTTP server that stores web objects
    - e.g., Apache
- HTTP operation: Defines how web clients (browsers) request web pages from web servers and how servers transfer those pages to clients

First, the browser sends an HTTP request message, and the server returns an HTTP response

- Transport layer protocol is TCP
- Stateless protocol
    - Server does not remember client history information
    - Lightweight control, can handle many HTTP connections simultaneously
