#### Delay and packet loss
Delay at eah node
- processing delay: the time to read header of packets and determin the output link. It also includes transmission failure check. ( normally under micro sec)

- queueing delay: the time to wait transmission. (normally less than 100 ms, but depends on buffer size)

- transmission delay: the time to transmit a packet to communication link. (depends on capacities of link $R$ bps and the function of packet size $\frac{L}{R}$.)
- propagation delay: the time that 1 bit size information reach the next node. (little bit slower than light speed about $2 \times 10^8$ to $3\times10^8 [m/s]$)
